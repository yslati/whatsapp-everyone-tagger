## Troubleshooting

### "Could not establish connection" error
If you installed the extension while WhatsApp Web was already open, you'll need to reload the page. The extension will prompt you to do this automatically.

### Tags appearing in search bar
The extension automatically detects and avoids the search bar. If you experience issues, try updating to the latest version.

## Privacy

This extension:
- Does not collect or store any user data
