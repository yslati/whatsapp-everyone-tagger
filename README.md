## Troubleshooting

### ✅ Installation Issues (Fixed in v2.0.0!)
**New in v2.0**: The extension now works immediately after installation! No more manual refresh needed.

- **Automatic setup**: Extension automatically injects into existing WhatsApp Web tabs
- **Smart detection**: If refresh is needed, you'll see a notification with one-click fix
- **Welcome page**: First-time users get a helpful setup guide

### Legacy Issues (Mostly Fixed)

### "Could not establish connection" error
**Fixed in v2.0.0!** The new background service worker automatically handles script injection.

### "Could not find group members list" error
**Fixed in v1.4.0!** The new version works with all group types including community groups and large groups.

### Tags appearing in search bar
The extension automatically detects and avoids the search bar. If you experience issues, try updating to the latest version.

### Clear text not working
The extension uses advanced clearing methods specifically designed for WhatsApp's rich text editor. If clearing doesn't work:
- Try refreshing the WhatsApp Web page
- Ensure you're in a group chat (not individual chat)
- Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages

### Inline button not showing
- Make sure you're in a group chat (button only appears in groups)
- Check that "Show @everyone button" is enabled in the extension popup
- Try refreshing the WhatsApp Web page

### Tagging seems slow or incomplete
- Try using "Slow" speed setting for better reliability
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- For very large groups (50+ members), "Slow" speed is recommended

### International phone numbers not being tagged
**Fixed in v1.4.0!** The extension now properly preserves the '+' prefix for international numbers, ensuring they work correctly with WhatsApp's tagging system.

### First group member missing
**Fixed in v1.4.0!** The improved participant detection prevents the first member from being incorrectly filtered out.
