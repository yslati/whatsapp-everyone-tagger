# Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Everyone Tagger

WhatsApp Everyone Tagger does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and only interacts with the WhatsApp Web interface when you click the "Tag Everyone" button.

No information is sent to any external servers, and no analytics or tracking is implemented.

The extension requires permissions to access the WhatsApp Web page only to identify group members and insert @ mentions in the text input field.
